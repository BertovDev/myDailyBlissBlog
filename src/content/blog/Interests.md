My interest might change a lot, mostly those that change or disappear are not fully aligned with my values and myself, their are just experimental.

In the other hand the ones that stays strongly placed in place, those are generally more life oriented ones, which I would like to write about in an isolated article due this is only a kind of reminder to myself and a form of expression, but I found important to mention them.

So now I find myself truly aligned and interested in various math oriented topics, what I mean that all of them includes some form of math no matter the level of complexity of them. So those are <span class="inline-block" style="color: #9571D5;font-weight:800"> probability, statistics, game theory, shader programming </span>

Those are the currents technical interests I am currently dabbling into, these are all topics I self-teach myself, reading everything I encounter that I find interesting. It is the most natural way of learning, doing for sake of curiosity and necessity to learn more. I also picked some of them because I find their application in every subject possible, and this basically because math is the language that the nature speaks.

<br />

As a mentioned earlier those interest might change, their are not untouchable, but I do have some that will not be changed any sooner or later. <span style="color: #9571D5;font-weight:800"> Happiness, mental clarity, self-awareness </span>, all of these seems to be endless topics to discovers, which makes them even more interesting. You do always have a different actor that will cause them, and It will change over the time, the point here is to find the one that will stay the same for at least a long period of time.

<br/>

<span class="text-[#ffebcd] text-bold italic"> Is a fact that long term interest are truly more important not matter the topics, relationship, business, learning or anything else, you should always aim for the long term and compound interest them.</span>
